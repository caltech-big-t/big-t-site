# Eric Chen
## Co-Editor-in-Chief
#### senior // computer science // [echen@caltech.edu](mailto:echen@caltech.edu)

Eric joined the _Big T_ mostly interested in photography, but was slowly repurposed as a designer/writer on account of his not having a camera. The internal structure of an Eric is not well known, but his emission spectrum suggests the presence of Linux, Javascript, and software engineering, with signs of anime and spreadsheet formulas. He hopes that one day humans and computers will again live in harmony.
