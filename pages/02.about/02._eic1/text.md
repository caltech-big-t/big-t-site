# Katherine Chang
## Co-Editor-in-Chief
#### senior // acm + economics // [kchang5@caltech.edu](mailto:kchang5@caltech.edu)

Katherine joined the Big T in freshman year as a spread designer because she's broke and wanted free access to Adobe Creative Cloud (just kidding, but also...). Outside of yearbook, she enjoys bullet journaling, musicing, and stockpiling Tuesday dinner cookies in her room. At the moment, her research interests include behavorial economics and figuring out what people are thinking before they think it.!
