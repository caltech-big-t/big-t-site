#### junior // physics // [suung@caltech.edu](mailto:suung@caltech.edu)
Shu Fay joined the Big T as a freshman, contributing as a copy-writer and spread designer before also fooling around as a photographer ([some pictures](https://www.flickr.com/people/shufay/)). On campus, she also shoots photos for the [athletics department](https://www.gocaltech.com/sports/wbkb/index) and is involved with the [undergraduate physics club](http://physicsclub.clubs.caltech.edu). She is certainly/uncertainly interested in quantum chemistry and its intersection with quantum computing.
