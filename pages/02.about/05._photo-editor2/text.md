# Selina Zhou
## Co-Photography Editor
#### sophomore // electrical engineering // [szhou@caltech.edu](mailto:szhou@caltech.edu)
Selina joined the Big T for a legit excuse to take photos of interesting people and events (see Instagram [@znilesuohz](https://www.instagram.com/znilesuohz/) for non-Caltech photos). Outside of yearbook, she extends her interest in picture taking to researching optics and photonics as an EE undergrad.
