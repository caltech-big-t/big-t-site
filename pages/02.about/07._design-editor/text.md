# Sharon Chen
## Design Editor
### junior // computer science // [stchen@caltech.edu](mailto:stchen@caltech.edu)

Sharon joined the Big T freshman year as a copy-writer and has since explored her interest in graphic design by creating spreads. Aside from designing for the Big T, she also works in an on-campus lab, writing software programs to control and test fibers for the Prime Focus Spectrograph instrument that will be installed in the Subaru Telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. Off-campus, Sharon loves finding fresh new eats and co-owns a food Instagram account (@sharone_and_pamela_eating) where she explores the best food establishments around Pasadena and LA.
