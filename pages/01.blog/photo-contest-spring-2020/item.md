The Big T is holding a campus-wide photo contest for all undergrads!

We’re asking you to submit photos of your favourite memories from both _on and off-campus_ from this school year. The contest will be judged by the Big T Photography Staff, and we’ll also have community choice voting for each category. One photo from each category and a community-choice winner will be featured in the opening or closing of the 2019-20 book as well as posted on our website.

The categories are:
* People
* Nature/Architecture
* Home workspace
* Food
* Zoom virtual background
* Miscellaneous

The deadline to submit photos is **May 13th**, which is in **4 days**! Public voting will take place after we get all submissions.

Submit your photos [here](https://forms.gle/M7UQzQMFPDZzzJtR6).
