Calling **all grad and undergrad students**! The Big T Yearbook is holding a special photography contest to celebrate our 100th anniversary, with **cash prizes**! This year, we’re asking for photos that you feel were emblematic of your Caltech experience from any year you’ve been at Caltech.
 
We’re taking photos both from on-campus and off-campus **as long as it was Caltech affiliated** (house activities, research trips, group meetings, etc. all would count), so please submit all of your favorite photos! Winning photos will be featured in the yearbook, as well as posted on our website. Additionally, the first place, second place, and third place winners will receive 100, 75, and 50 USD respectively!
 
The deadline to submit photos is **June 15, 2021**, which is after the end of the spring term. **Submit your photos here:** [https://forms.gle/M9kiLrwVixuGJAUNA](https://forms.gle/M9kiLrwVixuGJAUNA).

Stay safe!
