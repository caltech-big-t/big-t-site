***
_The Big T_ is holding a **campus-wide photo contest for all undergrads**! As this is the Big T’s 100th year anniversary, we’re asking you to submit photos that you feel were emblematic of your Caltech experience from any year you’ve been at Caltech. The contest will be judged by the Big T Photography Staff, with a selection of the best photos being published in the book. We’ll also highlight some of the best photos on this website.
 
We’re taking photos both from on campus and off campus **as long as it was Caltech affiliated** (house and class trips, orientation, etc. all would count), so please submit all of your favourite photos! Winning photos will be featured in the yearbook, as well as posted on our website.
 
The deadline to submit photos is **May 4th, 2021**, which is the end of the midterms period in 3rd term. **Submit your photos here:** [https://forms.gle/M9kiLrwVixuGJAUNA](https://forms.gle/M9kiLrwVixuGJAUNA).

Stay safe!
