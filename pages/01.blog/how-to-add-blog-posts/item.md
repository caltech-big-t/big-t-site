Instructions on how to write a blog post for this site.

===

So you want to write a blog for the site? Great! If you've never used Grav before, this will be useful.

Once you're logged in at [the admin portal](https://bigt.cf/admin), go to "Pages" in the left sidebar. In the top right corner, there will be a button that says "Add Blog Item". Click that, enter a title, and click "Continue". 

All blog pages should start off with a short summary, of the form:

```
Put your summary here.

```

Pages for this site are written in _Markdown_, a light markup language used for typesetting. A cheatsheet can be found [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code), but the easier way is to use the formatting bar at the top of the editor. 

To add media, upload files by clicking in the area below the editor labelled "Page Media". Embed images with `![link text](image_name)`.
